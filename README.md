This app creates a "store" for all products and their departments. 
There is a customor side which is where you can go to select an item from a department and purchase. You will either be allowed to purchase said item if there is enough in inventory or told to try back later when inventory is updated. 
The manager side is where you can edit products, add new products and add more inventory. 
Eventually there will be a supervisor side where you can check profits and costs.
